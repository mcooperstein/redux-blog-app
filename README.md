# Redux Blog Project

Communicates POST/GET/DELETE requests with simple API: reduxblog.herokuapp.com/api

### Will soon refactor to use Firebase to add the following features:

1. Include Date of Posts (using momentJS library)
2. Search bar to search by Title or Categories
3. Add button to sort by Date of Posts
